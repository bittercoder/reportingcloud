The ReportingCloud is a fork from the original project fyiReporting 4.1 (http://www.fyireporting.com).

The fyiReporting RDL Project is a powerful report and charting system based on
Report Definition Language (RDL). Tabular, free form, matrix, charts are fully
supported.  Report output may be displayed as HTML, PDF, Excel, RTF, XML, .Net
Control, Web Archive, and to a printer.

Since the fyiReporting project is stopped in the 4.1 version (Febrary 2009)
then I decided to make a fork (April 2010) called ReportingCloud.

From now on we have fyiReporting that following totally RDL specification and 
ReportingCloud based on fyiReporting but adding new features that may not be 
included in the RDL specification.
